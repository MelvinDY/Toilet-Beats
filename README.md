🚽 Toilet Games: Battle for the Throne
A hilariously awful (but secretly amazing) 2-player arcade created for the Terrible Idea Hackathon, themed around “Connection” – because nothing connects people quite like battling for a piece of toilet paper 💩.

🎮 Included Minigames
🕹 Rhythm Game
Smash keys to the beat! P1 uses WASD, P2 uses UHJK. First to 4000 points wins.

🧻 Toilet RPS
Wipe beats Plunge, Plunge beats Flush, Flush beats Wipe. First to 3 wins gets the paper roll.

🐍 Two-Player Snake
Avoid crashing into each other, the walls… or yourself. Only one snake will remain coiled in victory.

🏓 Toilet Pong
Ping pong, but way worse. Control your paddle and survive the chaos.

🏆 Win Condition
Each minigame victory earns you 1 roll of toilet paper 🧻

First player to collect 2 rolls becomes the Toilet Champion 👑

The loser? They walk away with nothing but shame and a clogged ego.

😈 Why Toilet Games?
Because bad ideas bring people together.
This chaotic pile of HTML, React, and emojis was built in under 48 hours to honor the Terrible Idea Hackathon. We took the theme “Connection” literally… and flushed it down the toilet.

Made to make you laugh, sweat, and argue over pixelated poop-based victory.
